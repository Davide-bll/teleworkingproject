###### 1) EXTRACT DATA from OSEMBE model dataset #########
We identified 4 different types of structure in the Data. Each Structure has been trated different.
The Osembe model has a different structure, so we adapted those data in order to obtain the input Parameters "Like in Utopia Data".

##STRUCTURE 1##
Non-timeslice dependent parameter. 
They have first been disaggregated, according to the OSEMBE legend, and then they have been visualized in the Shiny Application.
Link: https://teleworkingproject.shinyapps.io/exploratoryData/
We decided to distinguish two different observation only by technology and fuels. We have (re)aggregated the data in order to satisfy 
that rule.

1.1 DISAGGREGATION from OSEMBE  
"dataexploration.R" script.
1.2 REAGGREGATION into FUEL - TECHNOLOGY
"dataaggregation.R" script.


##STRUCTURE2##
timeslice dependent parameters.
After common evaluation of the problem, we decided to maintain the Osembe timeslice strategy: 5 season, 3 day-brackets.
2. specifieddemandprofile
"specifieddemandprofile.R" script
2.capacityfactor
"capacityfactor.R" script

##STRUCTURE3##
Similar to structure1
str3.R script
##STRUCTURE4##
writed manually in GAMS.

NOTES: In case we decide to use the 3-season 3 day-brackets strategy, the mapping between the 2 different dimension spaces has been created.
and now it makes sense. (every column sum to 1) 
it's in the "userfunctions.R" script, the function is "fromOSEtoGAMS", which basically find a linear mapping between 
two vector that sums to 1, so that every component of the input is totally used, never under/over-used.

2) GDX parameters creation.
"gdx_generation.R" creates the gdx parameters fie which contains structure 1-2-3 data. It uses gdxtools library.
Some modifications are also done in order to adapt the data to the "Utopia strategy" code. 
NB TECHNOLOGY is 4 letters tag now.
